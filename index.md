# QUOTE GENERATOR

## Introduction
<p style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
This is a Rust Command-Line application that fetches quotes from my X (Twitter) account and displays them on the terminal. 
It's purpose is to have some fun, read about interesting, motivational or perhaps life changing quotes, haha. 
It's useful after long hours of coding on the terminal. The quotes are a mixture of my own and others from all over the world. I hope you enjoy them.
