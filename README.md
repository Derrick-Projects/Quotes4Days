This Rust Command-Line application fetches quotes from my X (Twitter) account and displays them on the terminal. 
Its purpose is to have fun and read about interesting, motivational, or perhaps life-changing quotes, haha. It's useful after long hours of coding on the terminal. 
The quotes are a mixture of my own and others from all over the world. I hope you enjoy them.
