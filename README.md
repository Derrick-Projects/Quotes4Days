# Quote Generator
This is a rust command line application where it fetches quotes from my twitter and dispalys them on the terminal.
It's purpose is to have some fun, read about interesting, motivational or perhaps life changing quotes, haha. 
Useful after long hours of coding on the terminal.
The quotes are of a mixture of my own and others from all over the world, hope you enjoy.
